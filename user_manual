This is the manual for any user that would wants to do modifications in my work.

The first thing to look at is the file called 02-beats-input.conf on the server.
It is stored in the folder named /etc/logstash/conf.d/

The second part of my work is on Kiaban web GUI.
You will see a certain number of saved objects. 
All those having the word "Errors" in their names are used for generating reports using Kibana's API.
All the saved object have filters to look for a certain type of logs that are retrieved.
The other saved objects are just for data visualization.

The third part is the scripts in the folder /home/ubuntu/ on the server.
There are two scripts, report.py and test_report.py
The first script is the one that will generate automatically reports in Kibana.
The reports will be available for download on Kibana in Management>Reporting section.
The second script is for testing new report you would like to add.
If the new report is welle generated, then you can add it in the report.py file.

The last part is the crontab for root user.
It is this that enables the automation of reports' generation.
You cannot modify this crontab unless you are granted the root status using sudo command.
I will not divulgate the password here.
If you need to be root, you should ask the person in charge of the server.
However if you change the script report.py, it will be considered even though you are not root.
